This repository compiles two projects used to demonstrate financial analysis and strategic decision-making using Power BI.
Project 1: Company Analysis
This project used the Financial Sample dataset to design a comprehensive two-page dashboard for H+ Company. Page 1 focuses on key metrics such as Sales, Profit %, COGS, and Profit across time to find trends and overall profitability and revenue. Page 2 features visuals designed to generate deeper insights about profitability analyzed by customer segment, country, and discount.

Project 2: M&A Analysis — H+ vs. Binaryville
This project compares two potential acquisition targets from two fictional companies: H+ and Binaryville. Using a 3-page dashboard in Power BI, I analyzed overall profitability as well as segment-based product-level and regional concentration.
The analysis dives deep into product-level profitability, regional market share (North America vs. International), and the specific impact of discount strategies on margins. By combining technical data modeling with business acumen, this project demonstrates how to drive M&A decision-making through data-driven insights.
